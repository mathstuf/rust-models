impl: 
    1. touch any rs file in src before running. 
    2. compile and then run tests. 
    3. touch any rs file after running. 
    
    3. define custom datatypes. 
    4. getters for forign keys. 

bugs: 
    it sometimes adds columns that are later removed my a move in sqlite, so they are added again later. 
done: 
    # generate migrations in the right order. 


test: 
    1. make constraints removable
    2. make constraints addable
    3. allow changing constraints
    4. drop constraints on cascade
    5. add default parameters
